# Project Details, GitHub Statistics & Activity Tracking

This update marks a significant upgrade to the portfolio: improved navigation, detailed project pages, and in-depth analysis of GitHub activity.

Date: 28 January 2026

## Project Cards → Detail Pages

- Added a **“View project details”** button on each project card.
- This button redirects to a **dedicated page for each project**.
- Smooth, modern interface with icons and clear visual hierarchy.
- All key project information is centralised on a single page.
