      "question1": {
        "question": "How can I contact you?",
        "answer": "You can email me at contact@paulviandier.com or use the contact form in the Contact section."
      },
      "question2": {
        "question": "Which languages and technologies do you work with?",
        "answer": "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I also use Node.js for APIs and scripts."
      },
      "question3": {
        "question": "Which projects can I check out?",
        "answer": "All my projects are listed in the Projects section. Each project page explains the goal, the technical choices, and the outcome."

        "question": "Do you work more as a front-end developer or full-stack?",
        "answer": "I’m strongly front-end oriented (UI/UX, performance, accessibility), but I can also handle part of the back end (APIs, authentication, integrations). Long-term, my goal is to build strong full-stack skills."
      },
      "question6": {
        "question": "Do you use UI component libraries, or do you build components yourself?",
        "answer": "Both. I use solid foundations (Radix, shadcn/ui) when it makes sense, and I build custom components when a precise result is needed."
      },
      "question7": {
        "question": "How do you handle performance and SEO?",
        "answer": "Image optimization, progressive loading, code-splitting, clean metadata, sitemaps, and Next.js best practices."

      },
      "question9": {
        "question": "What’s your development workflow?",
        "answer": "I start from a clear goal, build a quick UI base, then iterate: code quality, manual testing, performance, and polish."
      },
      "question10": {
        "question": "Can you work from an existing design?",
        "answer": "Yes. I can implement a Figma design faithfully, or propose a simple, consistent UI direction if needed."
      },
      "question11": {
        "question": "How do you handle internationalization (i18n)?",
        "answer": "With next-intl: clean locale-based routing, structured translations, and language-appropriate date/time formats and typography."
      },
      "question12": {
        "question": "Do you follow coding standards?",
        "answer": "Yes: strict TypeScript, reusable components, naming conventions, lint/format, and a clear separation between UI and logic."
      },
      "question13": {
        "question": "How do you manage state and data?",
        "answer": "Depending on the need: local React state, lightweight stores when necessary, and server/client fetching with proper loading and error handling."
      },
      "question14": {
