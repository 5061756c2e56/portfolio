      "question1": {
        "question": "How can I contact you?",
        "answer": "You can email me at contact@paulviandier.com or use the contact form in the Contact section."
      },
      "question2": {
        "question": "Which languages and technologies do you work with?",
        "answer": "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I also use Node.js for APIs and scripts."
      },
      "question3": {
        "question": "Which projects can I check out?",
        "answer": "All my projects are listed in the Projects section. Each project page explains the goal, the technical choices, and the outcome."

        "question": "Do you work mainly as a front-end developer or full-stack?",
        "answer": "I'm strongly front-end oriented (UI/UX, performance, accessibility), but I can also handle some back-end work (APIs, authentication, integrations). Long term, my goal is to build strong full-stack skills."
      },
      "question6": {
        "question": "Do you use UI component libraries, or do you build components yourself?",
        "answer": "Both. I use solid foundations (Radix, shadcn/ui) when it makes sense, and I build custom components when a specific result is needed."
      },
      "question7": {
        "question": "How do you handle performance and SEO?",
        "answer": "Image optimisation, progressive loading, code splitting, clean metadata, sitemaps, and Next.js best practices."

      },
      "question9": {
        "question": "What's your development workflow?",
        "answer": "I start with a clear goal, build a quick UI baseline, then iterate: code quality, manual testing, performance, and polish."
      },
      "question10": {
        "question": "Can you work from an existing design?",
        "answer": "Yes. I can implement a Figma design faithfully, or propose a simple, consistent UI direction if needed."
      },
      "question11": {
        "question": "How do you handle internationalisation (i18n)?",
        "answer": "With next-intl: clean locale-based routing, structured translations, and language-appropriate date/time formats and typography."
      },
      "question12": {
        "question": "Do you follow coding standards?",
        "answer": "Yes: strict TypeScript, reusable components, naming conventions, linting/formatting, and a clear separation between UI and logic."
      },
      "question13": {
        "question": "How do you manage state and data?",
        "answer": "Depending on the needs: local React state, lightweight stores when necessary, and server/client fetching with proper loading and error handling."
      },
      "question14": {
        "question": "Can you integrate external APIs or services?",
        "answer": "Yes: authentication, payments, email, analytics, CMS, and anything that provides a reliable API."

Although I am at the beginning of my career, I am very comfortable with IT in general and have already explored several technical fields.",
      "p3": "In particular, I have trained in <b>front-end development</b> and built a solid foundation in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, along with initial experience of <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, working with <b>APIs</b>, <b>Git</b> and <b>responsive design</b>. I am used to integrating interfaces from <b>Figma mock-ups</b>, ensuring the visual outcome, code structure and user experience are all respected.",
      "p4": "Much like a well-organised <b>construction site</b>, I take the time to lay <b>clean foundations</b> before adding features. This approach helps me deliver <b>clear</b>, <b>consistent</b> interfaces that adapt well to <b>different devices</b>.",
      "p5": "My interest in <b>systems</b>, <b>networks</b> and <b>cybersecurity</b> has made me mindful of robustness, best practice and maintainability. I try to apply these principles from the integration phase onwards, in order to deliver code that is <b>reliable</b> and <b>easy to understand</b> for other developers.",
      "p6": "<b>Serious</b>, <b>motivated</b> and <b>team-oriented</b>, I am ready to fully commit to your projects while continuing to learn from experienced professionals. This apprenticeship represents an essential step for me to progress technically and contribute concretely to your work.",
